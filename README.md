# Euler
My solutions to the ProjectEuler.net problems I have solved. Will contain spoilers. Don't just copy and run the code. Use this to compare to your own solutions.

Of course I can't make you not steal my solutions to problems you haven't solved, but there is litterally no reason to do that. 
You only destroy the fun for yourself. Seeing this project as a purely educational I don't see any point in hiding my solutions either.
